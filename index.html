                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <h3>Education</h3>
                    <p>
                           I don't remember when and where I went to a kindergaten. All I recall is my Mother forcing me to go to school every morning <q>with a staff in her hand.</q>
                           I went to Nyamuga Primary School in Nyamuga, Kamagambo, Rongo in Migori.
                           I did my High school at Nyarach Mixed School in Rongo, Kenya. I am currently doing my Bachelor's Degree in Multimedia University, taking software Engineering

                    <h3>Experiences</h3>
                    <p>
                        I have trained Students back in former High school; I handle Physics as a Whole and mathematics. I worked with the head of National registries as a Data analyst and clerk. I help analyze a business plan for a newly beginning business <em>The Baby Shop is today making a profit of 60% quarterly</em>

                    <h4>Why I chose programming</h4>
                    <p>
                        I have always aspired to become a doctor, surgeon. I failed in the main subject of qualification and thought could not do it anymore. I decided to take a side carrier and landing in programming. My ambition is to explore the computer technology in the field of medicine and My dream is to create <q><b>a medical hub.</b></q> So that is entirely why I joined this programming class.

                <h2><u>What I like doing</u></h2>
                <p>
                    I am so passionate about finding out  <strong>the reason why</strong> somethings happen the way they happen. I am a reader of great books, a watcher of great plays, dramas and little of Scientific fictions. I ove having fun and could be I laugh the most when something funny happens. I love alot about good cookbooks. I enjoy good foods.
                    <br>
                    Before I forget, I love adventuring, touring and treats. I must also say that i love worrying about people and helping them whenever I can. <br>
