            <p>Reading is my hobby. I love reading purposefully for research about the truth, exploration of new skills people ever discovered and Yes!, to discover my own too.

I decided to take a side carrier and landing in programming. My ambition is to explore the computer technology in the field of medicine and My dream is to create <q><b>a medical hub.</b></q> So that is entirely why I joined this programming class.
