            <p>
                I have always aspired to become a doctor, surgeon. I failed in the main subject of qualification and thought could not do it anymore. I decided to take a side carrier and landing in programming. My ambition is to explore the computer technology in the field of medicine and My dream is to create <q><b>a medical hub.</b></q> So that is entirely why I joined this programming class.
